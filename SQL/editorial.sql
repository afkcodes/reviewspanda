(1, '', '', '', '', 'The Guardian view on Donald Trump: using hate as b', '', '<p>onald Trump is still sometimes depicted as impulsive and unpredictable. But this view is mistaken. There is method – albeit an evil method – in his madness. His behaviour in the build-up to next week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2018\">US midterm elections</a> highlights this side of the president. He has been consistent and unscrupulous in pursuing it. Fearing that voters will elect an anti-Trump Congress on 6 November, he has made a clear choice to use hate and division to bait and provoke his opponents into a backlash which, he hopes, will energise white voters to support Republican candidates at the polls.</p><p>At least three of Mr Trump’s actions this week can only be adequately explained by this strategy. In the first, he has ordered 5,200 active duty American troops to the US-Mexico border. The objective here is not to respond to a crisis – several thousand National Guard are already there, as well as border police – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/border-security-troops-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">but to create one</a>. Mr Trump wants to make a show of force against a caravan of migrants from Central America, which he has mischievously described as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056919064906469376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1056919064906469376&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F10%2F29%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fcaravan-trump-shooting-elections.html\">an invasion</a> and which he has falsely said contains “unknown Middle Easterners”. Not only is this claim untrue, but the caravan itself is daily shrinking in size and it is still in southern Mexico, weeks away from reaching the US border. Mr Trump is using his nation’s troops as partisan political props.</p><p>The second example of Mr Trump’s cynicism is his response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/29/pittsburgh-shooting-suspect-robert-bowers-court\">slaughter of 11 Jews</a> in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. On Tuesday, as the first dead from the synagogue gun massacre were being buried, Mr Trump was preparing to visit Pittsburgh in the teeth of widespread opposition. Many families of the victims, along with Pittsburgh’s mayor, asked the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-trump-visit-mayor-city-divided\">to stay away</a>. Pennsylvania’s two US senators, and congressional leaders of both parties, chose not to accompany Mr Trump. But he was undeterred. He preferred to barge in and grandstand on a day of private grief. Why behave this way? Not because he is a national uniter, as other presidents have tried to be at such moments, but because he is a divider and a provoker.</p><p>This week’s third determination to create a crisis and to use it to frighten white voters to the polls came in an interview released on Monday. Mr Trump has chosen this moment to try to end the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/politics/donald-trump-ending-birthright-citizenship/index.html\">right to American citizenship</a> of babies born in the United States to non-citizens. Mr Trump is himself the son of an immigrant mother, the US constitution has recognised this birthright for over 150 years, and it is doubtful he could simply order the change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-14th-amendment\">as he pretends</a>. But the president could not be clearer about his darker intentions. He is determined to do everything to make immigration – and that means race – the explicit centrepiece of these elections.</p><p>Everything Mr Trump will say over the next seven days will be dedicated to this hate-filled strategy. Even the exceptions prove the rule. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/19/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-accuser-threats\">Christine Blasey Ford</a> alleged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> had sexually assaulted her, Mr Trump called her a credible witness. Days later, he mercilessly mocked her at a political rally. Now the same pattern has been repeated after pipe bombs were sent to Democratic politicians. Mr Trump initially condemned the attacks as despicable. A day later he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/26/trump-rally-pipe-bombs-media-democrats\">complained that “this ‘bomb’ stuff”</a> had got in the way of Republican mobilisation. The true Trump does not hide for long.</p><p>Mr Trump is consistent, not inconsistent. He seeks to be the president of some of the people, not all of them. A man who hates half of his country has no right to call for a unity that he does not believe in and which, in a heartbeat, he is ready to trash and mock.</p>', 'Ashish', '16:18:38', 20),

Those dangerous beliefs are not shared by a majority of Conservatives, nor by a majority of leave voters.</p><p>The very act of calling a confidence vote expressed arrogance and hypocrisy. The arrogance is in believing that Britain’s destiny should be settled by internal debate within the Tory party – that at such a critical juncture, the prime minister can be chosen by around 100,000 Conservative members from a pair of candidates vetted by Tory MPs, disregarding the rest of the country. The hypocrisy is in trying such a thing in the name of democracy, claiming to channel “the will of the people” for a narrow partisan agenda.</p><p>Mrs May has many flaws and her misjudgments are a central cause of the current crisis, but not the only one. She has at least admitted that Brexit involves difficult trade-offs – between open trade and closed borders; between regulatory autonomy and market access. Leavers and remainers dislike the balance she has struck, but none can dispute that she has made choices. She does not pretend there is a perfect Brexit, which elevates her above challengers peddling dangerous no-deal fantasies. Mrs May must now be more explicit in excluding that option from the menu of possible Brexit outcomes.

He may be short in height, but he’s seldom short of confidence.It’s a great character, and in the hands of director Anand L Rai, writer Himanshu Sharma, and Shah Rukh himself, Zero opens with promise. They set upan authentic, textured world with characters that feel real. Bauua’s parents (Tigmanshu Dhulia and Sheeba Chaddha) are fed up of his wastrel lifestyle, never holding back for fear of hurting his feelings. His best friend (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub) meanwhile worships the ground he walks on.</p><p>The film switches gears when Bauua meets and falls for Anushka Sharma’s character Afiya, a brilliant scientist with cerebral palsy who’s confined to a wheelchair. Their meet-cute is a series of incidents where he refers to her as a “katipatang”, says things like “inse hilne ke alawa hota kya hai”, and in a moment straight out of a Farrelly Brothers-style black comedy he challenges her to lift a pen off the floor.</p><p>It made me question whether making jokes about someone’s disability is ok if the person making the joke is disabled or differently abled himself. The answer, I suppose, is in the fact that Afiya falls for him too despite his coarse manners.</p><p>Anushka, who can usually be trusted to deliver a competent performance, strains to portray Afiya’s condition convincingly. I don’t claim to be an expert on palsy but the acting is awkward and seldom consistent, and watching it made me cringe. Katrina Kaif does a lot better in the film’s other key role, playing Babita Kumari, a superstar actress whom Bauua has adored on screen for years. When we meet her, Babita has had her heart broken, and as a result she’s angry, permanently intoxicated, and, believe it or not, prone to kissing strangers on the highway. Katrina really gets into the part, bringing Babita’s pain and cynicism to the surface in a nicely realized performance.</p><p>It’s easy to see what the makers of Zero might have been going for – a story of three ‘damaged’ individuals, and how they end up healing each other. But that idea is buried under the weight of an overwrought screenplay that packs in much more than your patience can handle. By the time the second half kicks in, Zero feels like an entirely different film from the one we were promised.</p><p>Where’s the small-town, real world charm that has been the strong suit of this writer-director pair since Tanu Weds Manu? How did we land up at a space research facility in America? Why is this film competing with Om Shanti Om to set a record for maximum cameos? These and a dozen other questions were swimming in my head as the film hobbled towards its climax, clocking in at nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes. The problem isn’t just that the film is too long. It’s that there are so many scenes that are completely incoherent.</p><p>It’s a shame Zero comes undone, because the ambition and the effort is visible. Shah Rukh Khan is especially entertaining in the first half while the script stays on track. But in the end it feels as if the makers threw everything at the wall and decided to see what sticks. Unfortunately, very little does. I’m going with two out of five for Zero.</p>', 'Kunal', '20:31:49', 42),

From the streets of Bombay to the fields of KGF, he embarks on the mission. And his tale is retold by a journalist who chronicled his life in the 1980s.</p><p><br><strong>KGF Movie Review: </strong>Prashanth Neel\'s KGF, which stars Yash in the lead, has become arguably the most spoken about Kannada film, which has been dubbed in Tamil, nationally. The expectations have been enormous. Does the team deliver? Yes, they do. The film has a fast-paced first half, which does seem a little long, but the second half and the climax set up the right premise for the second part of the film.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The screenplay is the most interesting part of the film. The non-linear pattern keeps the viewers engaged, with the growth of Rocky being shown in a steady fashion. While there are a fair share of scenes and dialogues that bring out the hoots and cheers from the masses, the makers have still maintained a clever storytelling pattern that assures one to also keep pace with the narrative. The film traverses from 1951 to 2018, while maintaining a sense of curiosity as each character is unveiled.</p><p><br>Adding the extra edge to the film are the cinematography, art direction and the locales. Everything looks top notch and one is often left spellbound at the scenes. Be it the dark dreary world in KGF to the more glitzy nightlife scenes in Bangalore, all of them are shown beautifully. Yash, as Rocky, lives his character to the fullest and his screen presence definitely has the viewers cheering alongside him. The ensemble cast play their respective parts, with each of them playing minor building blocks in setting up Rocky\'s character.</p><p><br>The narrative in the first part builds the character of Rocky as the maverick mastermind who will not stop for anything until he reaches his mission. While there is a sense of temporary closure in the first chapter of the film, one also leaves the hall yearning for more. KGF surely seems to have delivered what it set to achieve</p>', 'Ashish', '23:52:19', 7),
(38, '2.O', '29-Nov-2018', 'Shankar', 'RajniKant, Akshay Kumar, Amy Jackson', 'So lets move to the next version', 'uploads/p16269020_v_v8_ab.jpg', '<p><strong>Sci-fi on steroids, but lacks solid stuff</strong><br><br><strong>2.0 Story: </strong>Dr Vaseegaran (Rajinikanth) and his android assistant Nila (Amy Jackson) are called in for help after mobiles start mysteriously flying out of the hands of people in Chennai. Vaseegaran summons his trusted robot Chitti (Rajinikanth) to ward off the bird-shaped supernatural powers of Pakshirajan (Akshay Kumar).<br><br><strong>2.0 Review: </strong>South films and filmmakers seem to have a handle on out-of-the-box ideas for cinema. Director Shankar has dabbled with such high-concept movies like Robot (2010, Tamil title Enthiran) and I (2015) before, too. While he’s no stranger to depicting far-fetched and creative ideas, the unique story of 2.0 does feel a bit underwhelming, especially in the wake of the spectacle created by the CGI-driven execution. The slick visual presentation though, more than makes up for what the story lacks.&nbsp;<br><br>The twists and surprises of 2.0 are predictable and the fact that the story follows the template set by the first film, doesn\'t really add to the experience. But Shankar’s vision and his team’s technical wizardry with the visual effects creates a positive impact. Akshay Kumar’s shape-shifting antagonist Pakshi, made up of millions of cellphones is impressive to say the least. There are several moments in the movie that are quite memorable too. The sight of mobiles covering up an entire road, a forest and forming the giant eagle, are most certainly ‘wow’ worthy. But the scientific explanations provided for telekinetic control of mobile phones and the antagonist’s supernatural abilities aren\'t all that convincing. Nevertheless, this is a Rajinikanth movie and questioning cinematic liberty and logic-defying creativity is unwarranted.<br><br>Rajinikanth’s performance and presence dominates the narrative. Shankar’s screenplay gives fans of the superstar plenty of moments to cheer for, especially with the fact that there are not one or two, but three iterations of his robotic character Chitti. Not just that, even the one-liners in the movie and the reference to Rajini’s numero uno status gives the fans plenty to cheer for. Akshay Kumar also gives a solid performance as the antagonist, especially in the flashback that reveals his character’s ornithology background. The presence of these two superstars is one of the main reasons why 2.0 feels like a grand, big-ticket movie.<br><br>The makeup and costumes are highlights of the movie, too. The effort to create Akshay’s character is really detailed you don’t need to be a VFX guru to realise that the characters of 2.0 really look authentic. The background score by AR Rahman and Qutub-E-Kripa also adds to feel of this futuristic film. While the movie certainly looks world-class, the writing doesn’t always live up to the expectations. It’s Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar’s star power that really saves the day for this magnum opus.</p>', 'Kunal', '28-12-2018', 1);
